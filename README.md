#ServingMultipleHTML
* Create a website with four routes:
  * Home
  * Favorite Foods
  * Favorite Movies
  * Favorite CSS Frameworks
* Each route should be triggered by a different URL.
* Each route should display an HTML page listing your favorite three things of each.
* Use `fs` to serve your HTML files.
